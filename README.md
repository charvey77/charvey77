Hello! I'm Chris Harvey (@charvey77). I've been a developer for 20+ years in varying industries.
- Video Games (Lords of the Realm III, Children of the Nile, Caesar IV, Sim City Societies, Lord of the Rings Online)
- Aerospace Software - Princeton Satellite Systems
- Science and Engineering - MathWorks (my current employer)

I'm mostly just tinkering around with side projects, trying to learn new technologies and put together small apps/programs
to help in that learning. 

Feel free to reach out to me at charvey.dev@gmail.com!
